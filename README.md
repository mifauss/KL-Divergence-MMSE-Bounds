# KL-Divergence-MMSE-Bounds
Code for the Paper "MMSE Bounds Under Kullback-Leibler Divergence Constraints on the Joint Input-Output Distribution", submitted to the *IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing*.

The MMSE bounds are implemented in `mmse_bounds.py`. See the examples for how to call the respective functions. The script `generate_figures.py` generates all figures in the same order as they appear in the paper.
